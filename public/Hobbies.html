<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<h2>Football</h2>
<p>I always play football with my friends when i got the occasion 
    and played in a football club from age 9 to age 15

<h2>Bouldering</h2>
<p>After that I tried bouldering and got a satisfactory level
    in the summer of 2024 and continued to climb consitantly after that.
</p>
<h2>Chess</h2>
<p>
    I begin playing chess when I was 6 and trained seriously until I was 14.
    I placed 9th,8th in respectively 2013 and 2015 in classical chess in my age category at 
    the french championship, 7,9th in respectively blitz and rapid in 2014.
    I also placed first in rotterdam in 2015 and twice top 5 of the netherlands:
    once in 2014 and once in 2021 at the under 18 chammpionship.
